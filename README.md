# Temporal Java SDK Workshop

This repository contains a Temporal Java SDK Workflow.
The workshop is intended for new / intermediate users of Temporal
that want to learn how to get started developing 
highly scalable, distributed, workflow-based applications.

The workshop is divided in to chapters. Each chapter has a 
README.md file which describes what you will learn in that chapter.

Each chapter also contains a "develop" and a "solution" package.
The "develop" package is intended for you to develop and writer
